The **PlantUML Gizmo Add-on** was created initially (2014) to help students easily put (and reuse) UML documentation inside their laboratory projects in software design courses at the École de technologie supérieure <img src="https://www.etsmtl.ca/getmedia/4efcf5f0-b7ec-4429-a5d8-28fd4571039c/ETS-rouge-devise-ecran-fond_transparent" alt="ETS" width="64">. It was one of the first Google Docs add-ons, and took 6 months to be approved. It's been used by Google's Android and Pay teams (I've interacted with their engineers).

This project was designed and coded by [Christopher Fuhrman](https://etsmtl.ca/Professeurs/cfuhrman/Accueil?lang=en-CA) with help and encouragement from [Arnaud Roques](https://github.com/arnaudroques) and the crew at PlantText.com ([Arwen Vaughan](https://github.com/arwenvaughan)).
